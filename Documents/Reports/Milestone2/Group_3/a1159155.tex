{\large \textbf{\underline{SEGP2 Milestone 2 Individual Report of Ken S'ng Wong}}}

\textbf{Total Hours Spend:} approx. 40 hours

Milestone 2 started with the assignment of tickets from the group meeting. Previously, I was assigned to address the problem described in Ticket 66, the group had agreed to let me take the responsibilities of the group contact. 

Almost half of the total hours spend were on planning, resource allocation and helping the group get up to speed on the project. The remainder hours were spend on testing and refining Ticket 66. 

Although Ticket 66 were not part of the Master Plan for Milestone 2, it was mentioned that the problem was addressed in Milestone 1, but no tests were performed on the solution implemented. Also, it was found out that the solution implemented has a flaw of not showing the latest updates in disk usage sizes when there is no change to a file. 

Besides testing Ticket 66 and planning, approximately two to three hours were spend on exploring test coverage using the tool rcov. A short presentation was given on the 16$^{th}$ May lecture at 1400 hours. 

Moving forward, I plan to contribute more on the development and tests phases, as well as group management, in the next milestone.
