\textbf{Total Hours Spend:} approx. 20 hours

Due to unexpected road blocks (eg: hardware failure and personal issues), Ticket 27 was not completed in Milestone 2. 

Ticket 27 was carried forward from Milestone 1 as a catastrophic hardware failure happened on the development machine used had rendered all developments to a halt. 

However, with the newly acquired machine, this ticket is scheduled to be completed by 30$^{th}$ June, 2008. 

Moving forward, frequent backups are now part of the development routine.
