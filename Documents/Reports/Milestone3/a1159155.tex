\section*{Executive Summary}

I have basically did a preliminary research on the current plugin system found in Earth. Then, by requests, I conducted a tutorial for the group to pass down the findings proposals I have during my research to the group. Besides having a tutorial, I have also prepared some notes and documents about the plugin system. These notes and documents include my written notes and diagrams to make understanding the plugin system easier for beginners. Also, I did some experiments directly on the codes show how the plugin system should work for the Controllers and Views, while advising the Daemon should follow the same design. Finally, I was off to Apple's World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco.
