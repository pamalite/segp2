\section*{Resource Contributions}

The integration was started with the help of Ming, solving several merge conflicts.  Some of the rake test were failing and therefore, Ken's help was needed due the his knowledges of specific pats of the system.

One of the major problems presented during the merging phase was that different versions of the same ticket were presented in several repositories, having to be merged by hand, making it difficult to know which version was the one to keep.  This was increased due to the lack of documentation of the code written.  Possible solutions that may reduce this problem
\begin{itemize}
 \item  Commenting the code added/modified with a brief description, and perhaps the date, help in finding out which is the latest version and the one to keep.
 \item  After completing something that is working correctly, it should be integrated and everybody should sync with it
\end{itemize}
