		\begin{itemize}
			\item Timeline
				\begin{itemize}
					\item David commented would like the sprint to be shorter.
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Consider the work hours of each members- each group has 3 MSE + 2 BE(SE) members
					\end{itemize}
					\item Ming initially suggested 6 hours due to the advice given by Matthew on the tickets picked for M2 can be challenging. 
					\item David's aim for this sprint is to get some basic functions of the tickets working rather than has nothing for 6 weeks.
					\item Ming suggested to split the tickets into smaller tasks that might take more time. 
					\item An agreement was reached by the group to have have the tickets' basics done by 25/05/2008 instead.

						\end{itemize}
					\item David: Break the tickets by functions instead. For example, one subgroup to work on the database, another subgroup to work on the search plugins.
