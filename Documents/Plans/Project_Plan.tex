\section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Purpose and Scope}

This project endeavours to build upon the existing framework that has already been developed for \textit{Earth}. Currently there exist a number of features that would be desirable to be implemented in this open source software. It is our aim to implement as many features as is necessary to further evolve Earth into a highly manageable and efficient tool.\\
\\
This document outlines the direction the project will take to best deliver the final product. In other words, this document will show how our team is assigned to deal with the task required of us. This project management plan looks at how we will deal with risks and how they will be mitigated and how they will be controlled should they arise. Furthermore, we show how we intend to develop additional features of Earth, showing not only the process model that we will use but also how the work is scheduled to take place.

\subsection{Project Deliverables}

The following section outlines when specific documents and deliverables will be completed and available. These are the main deliverables. However, more detailed information about internal milestones are provided in Section \ref{sec:work-plan}.

\subsubsection{First Document Drafts}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Software Project Management Plan - due 31/03/08
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evolution of the Plan}

This plan will be reviewed on a weekly basis for the duration of the project. In addition to these regular updates, every time our work on the project differs to the proposed workplan, this document will be updated as necessary. These changes may be made by any member of the group. To ensure that the project stays on track, along with this document, there are numerous risk management procedures in place. Furthermore, with regular meetings, we are able to stay aware of where we are compared to where we should be as set out by our milestones and deliverables.\\

\section{Risk Management Plan}

Detailed below are various risks that may affect the project and strategies for dealing with them.

\subsection{Staff unable to work due to sickness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} Moderate as Staff are vulnerable to various diseases such as the flu.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} It could be catastrophic if the absence is for a long period of time as some staff possess specialised knowledge in specific areas. However, if the time of absence is short, the severity will be tolerable.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Advanced notice from the staff member who will be unavailable or unable to work 
			\item Staff member does not attend meetings.
			\item Staff member complains about their health
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Organise staff to work in teams so that more than one person understands and can work on each task. This allows the team to continue working even if a member is unable to work.
			\item Provide time slack on all tasks so that other members have enough time to pick up the jobs of those unable to work.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Staff unable to work due to other commitments}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} Moderate as staff may have unexpected commitments such as business or family trips.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} It could be catastrophic if the absence is for a long period of time as some staff possess specialised knowledge in specific areas. However, if the time of absence is short, the severity will be tolerable.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Advanced notice from the staff member who will be unavailable or unable to work  
			\item Staff member does not attend meetings.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Organise staff to work in teams so that more than one person understands and can work on each task. This allows the team to continue working even if a member is unable to work.
			\item Provide time slack on all tasks so that other members have enough time to pick up the jobs of those unable to work.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Difficulty in adding features due to poor software design in existing code}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} Moderate as the code was likely developed to meet existing needs without foresight for unexpected but desired improvements.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} High as the time necessary to fix any design issues in the existing code to implement certain features could increase significantly.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Problems when attempting to design a feature to be implemented around the existing code.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Attempt to avoid features that may not be easily integrated with the existing code.
			\item Redesign of certain sections of existing code to implement new feature.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unable to contact Rising Sun Pictures to Clarify Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} Medium as the main developers of earth are situated at the Sydney office.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} Medium because it will not allow for certain requirements that require clarification to proceed until contact is made.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Lack of email response.
			\item Advanced notice that their offices are busy.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Proceed to other already clarified requirements.
			\item Prepare numerous requirements to clarify during meetings with Rising Sun Pictures.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lack of knowledge of Ruby, Rails, Git}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} The likelihood is high as all of the above tools are new to the development team.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} The severity is catastrophic as it would be extremely difficult to finish the project on time and with a high level of quality without knowledge of the tools.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Slow adoption of required set of tools upon selection
			\item Staff member complains about any of these tools
			\item Selection of these tools late, having reduced time to study them
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Inform the development team that these are the tools to be used in advance so that they have time learn to use them.
			\item Organise a tutorial or lectures of these tools and its functionality to show the developers how to use the tools and what they can be used for.
			\item Include time in the schedule for learning how to use these tools and their functionality.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements not completed on time - excessive number of requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} The likehood is moderate as the requirements selection is done internally.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} High as features intended for the final product will not be completed.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The number of requirements is too large.
			\item Clients continue adding more requirements
			\item Lack of sufficient communication between the development team and the clients causing the wrong requirements to be implemented.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Have the development team and the clients meet regularly to review the requirements and the progress of their implementation.
			\item Maximize the detail of the requirements in the SRS.
			\item Develop the project in such a way that adapting to new or changed requirements is easy. 
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements not completed on time - unreachable complexity of the requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} The likehood is high as it is likely that after delving into the existing code, that implementing a feature could become a much larger problem. 
	\item \textbf{Severity:} High as the system may be unable to work correctly or may behave in an incorrect or inefficient manner.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The level of difficulty of the implementation of the requirements is too high.
			\item Lack of sufficient communication between the development team and the clients causing the wrong requirements to be implemented.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Have the development team and the clients meet regularly to review the requirements and the progress of their implementation.
			\item Maximize the detail of the requirements in the SRS.
			\item Develop the project in such a way that adapting to new or changed requirements is easy. 
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Underestimate the development time to reach each milestone}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} The likelihood is medium as initial estimates of task time may be incorrect, and result in needing more time. 
	\item \textbf{Severity:} High as the project may be not delivered on time or may not reach the required quality level. 
	\item \textbf{Indicators:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Milestones not met on time.
			\item Requirements changing constantly.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Increase the free slack time of each milestone in order to have some extra time if needed.
			\item Reassign members/development teams to increase the speed at which the core components are completed.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New features of the project do not integrate correctly with Earth}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} The likelihood will depend on the level of integration required and how interconnected a component is. Therefore, the likelihood can vary from low to high.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} Moderate as time to analyse and fix problems may delay the feature being implemented
	\item \textbf{Indicators:} Feature doesn't work as intended with Earth
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Have input from multiple developers when designing components
			\item Begin integration early so that there is more time to deal with any problems that occur
			\item Have incremental integration with smaller components so that problems are easier to identify
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unable to work at the computer labs}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} Medium because while there are many labs, not all systems will have the necessary tools for this project.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} Low because it is not required to work in the computer labs.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Advance notice that the computer labs will not be available.
			\item No computers are available due to maintenance or use by other people
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Install the required tools on other computers or use remote access to computers that have the required tools.
			\item Install the required tools on computers in the SEP Labs.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Central Earth Git repository unavailable}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Likelihood:} Low as maintenance of the Git repository and its availability is the responsibility of a separate department.
	\item \textbf{Severity:} Low as each developer has their own copy of the Git repository to work on.
	\item \textbf{Indicators:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Degraded performance.
			\item Scheduled downtime or maintenance.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Strategies:} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Continued Development on local copies of the repository, with progress to be pulled/pushed once the repository is restored.
			\item Keep the number of files to a minimum by splitting work into groups and sections.
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Process Model}

Agile Process will be adopted for this project. This entails short development cycles, with many milestones to be met. In general we will adopt a 6 week development sprint, where requirements investigation and prototyping will occupy 1 week, with 3 weeks of development time and 1-2 weeks of testing time. This allows for developed and tested products and endorses incremental development.
\\

\section{Work Plan}
\label{sec:work-plan}

This project makes use of an iterative process where the existing code will be improved upon with additional features.

\section{Supporting Plans}

\subsection{Git Repository Process}

\subsubsection{Human Resources Allocation:}
\begin{itemize}	
\item Each group will have a GitHub leader who is responsible for their group's copy of the central repository.
\item The GitHub leaders will be responsible for the central repository.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Creation:}
\begin{itemize}	
\item At first, the GitHub manager should fork the origin from RSP repository. So, we will have: manager/earth
\item Then, GitHub leaders should fork (clone) their masters from the origin (i.e. manager/earth). So, we will have: leader1/earth, leader2/earth and leader3/earth
\item each leader should give all his group members permitions to push their group fork
\item Then, each group member should only clone the group's master fork to his local PC (i.e. leader1/earth, leader2/earth and leader3/earth).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Upon Completion of a task:}
\begin{itemize}	
\item He pulls the latest changes from the group's master. (git pull)
\item Test his task locally.
\item Pushes the changes.
\item Sends a pull request to the group GitHub leader (and all other group memebers). This request should include (at least): related task number or description, files changed, related ticket numbers. (this really a notification not a request since he already pushes his changes)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Upon pull request to Github Leader:}
\begin{itemize}	
\item The group GitHub leader reviews the changes in terms of: documentation standards, etc.
\item Performs the automated test to make sure that nothing is corrupted. (he could fully test the changes and approve it "for discussion in the meeting")
\item If the changes are approved: Sends a pull request to: all group members & GitHub manager about the changes:  related task number or description, files changed, related ticket numbers and person responsible.
\item If the changes are not approved: Reverts back the group's master  to its status before these changes are committed, and sends an email to the group member clarifying the reasons of rejecting the changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{When the GitHub manager receives a pull request from a GitHub leader:}
\begin{itemize}	
\item The Github manager pulls the latest changes from that group's master. (this could includes any necessary merges)
\item The GitHub manager performs an automated final test. (should be specified) 
\item If it passed the test successfully, sends a pull request to all other GitHub leaders so that they pull the latest changes to their forks.
(He could marks a version??)
\item If it does not pass the test: Reverts back the origin to its state before these changes, and inform the group GitHub leader by an email about the reasons. (or from the beginning, make a fake fork or branch for testing)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Milestone Completion:}
\begin{itemize}	
\item The GitHub manager marks a version/release 
\item He sends a pull request to Earth people. This should contain: Milestone features, (for discussion)
\end{itemize}
