\noindent {\large \textbf{\underline{Ticket 186 - Remove feature for Earth daemon}}} \\

\noindent {\normalsize \textbf{By} Alexander Egan}\\

\noindent \textbf{\large Task Progress}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Created a new ticket (Ticket 186) for the earth daemon remove feature.
\item It should remove a directory so that it is no longer monitored on the local host and allow historical tracking of files so that the location of deleted files can be identified.
\item Briefly scanned through the daemon code (earthd) to ascertain magnitude of task.
\item Planning to investigate further and document how it all works. This is aimed at providing better insights into how the daemon works and determining the most effective implementation of the remove feature.
\end{itemize}

\[\emph{End}\]
