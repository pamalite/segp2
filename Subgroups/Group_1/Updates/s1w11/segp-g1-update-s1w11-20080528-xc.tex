\paragraph{}

Task done for the last week:
\begin{itemize}
\item Added a ticket for the broken query problem.
\item Ticket 138 presentation on last Friday
\item There is a method find\_files\_down\_to\_level method under the model file directory.rb returns all 
files belonging to sub-directories of the current directory down to the given level. It contains a single 
query, but it takes almost 60\% of the overall running time, so we need to optimize the query.
\item Rewrite the query to eliminate the sub-queries, increased the speed by 0.5 seconds.
\item Planned to add a column in the files table with directories level, so we do not need JOIN in the query.
\end{itemize}

\[\emph{End}\]
