\paragraph{}
Since the last meeting, I finished the first edition of the Testing  
Process Document and the second revision of the  Repository Process  
Document. These were presented to the group on Monday at a meeting and  
it was agreed they were to be accepted. Ming suggested at the meeting  
that a section be added on how to work with branches in git and Ken  
suggested a section on troubleshooting conflicts be added. I will  
investigate what information should be in these sections and add them.

\paragraph{}
I was also assigned the task for the next milestone of implementing  
the remove feature to the Earth daemon so that directories can be  
removed from the database. My plan is to investigate the current  
features of the Earth daemon to see how they function and then work  
from there for implementing the remove feature. I will also create a  
Trac ticket for this task. I do not have any time estimates as yet for  
this.
