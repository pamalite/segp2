\section{Tasks Assigned}

Beginning of Milestone 4, we were assigned the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create API standards base on the file monitor

    \item Replace what is current available file monitor base on the API from above

\end{enumerate} 

\section{Resources}

We currently have five members that consists of 2 BE(SE) and 3 MES students. However, it is possible that one of the MES will not continue in this course

\section{Tasks Allocations}

We have broken down the tasks into smaller subtasks. Allocation of the group members to each of them will be done on July 30th 2008

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create API standards base on the functionality of the file monitor (this include DB but not GUI)
        \begin{enumerate}

        \item Look at the file monitor system and list (extract) the possible API methods needed (16 hours / 2 days AIM 31st July)

        \item Develop (code) the API it self (just for file monitor) 

                \begin{enumerate}

                \item Look where in the system the hooks should be in (8 hours / 1 day AIM 1st August)

                \item Create the hook if there is none, else modify the existing one (54 hours / 7 days AIM 12 August)

                \end{enumerate}

        \end{enumerate}


    \item Replace what is current available on file monitor 
        \begin{enumerate}

        \item Re-develop file monitor with the proposed API %this may need further clarification
                \begin{enumerate}

                \item implement (24 hours / 3 days AIM 15th August)

                \end{enumerate}

        \item publish standards and API (1 hour AIM 22do August)
